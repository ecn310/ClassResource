## Project Data Check-In

You will have to write documenation for your team's project data that will include...

- Short description of the data
  - Includes number of variables, number of observations for each data set (you may have more than one data set)
- Explanation of where the data comes from / how someone can acquire it / where you have stored it
- List of key variables you may use for testing your hypothesis
  - How you will link different data sets together if necessary

You will need to answer...

Has our team already accessed all the data we need?

- (If not) Do we have a plan to access it?
- (If not) What do we need to be able to make a plan?

## Putting Together Your Data Set

Learning objectives (Greenlaw Ch. 9, pp. 160-163):

1. Develop a search strategy for finding your data (applies even if you have a dataset recommended by a faculty member)
2. Obtain data that correctly measure the concepts that your theory deems important

**Develop a search strategy for finding your data:**

In order to find data that correctly measure the concepts that your theory deems important,

- START by reviewing your theoretical model.
- ask, “What variables do I need data for to test my research hypothesis?”
- rethink your hypothesis if you can’t answer the question, “If I could obtain ideal data, what variables would they include?”

Greenlaw Ch. 9 assumes you already have your hypothesis.

- We’ll use its ideas to help you reverse-engineer a hypothesis if necessary
- To start: What variables do you have that are related to the research question?

Obtain data that correctly measure the concepts that your theory deems important. Which question should you ask as you investigate a data source?

- What data are, in fact, available?
- If the data are not good enough, are they good enough?
- If the data are not acceptable and there is no adequate **proxy**, how can the hypothesis be reformulated to make it testable, given the data available?

Proxy: a variable that substitutes for another unavailable or unobserved variable (R&vR p. 113)

- This is needed when it’s too difficult or costly to directly quantify the ideal variable, or the ideal variable is not included in available datasets


### Proxy Variables

“Proxy variables are data that we hope captures the quantitative essence of a thing without actually measuring a thing. They are used a lot in data projects, mostly because we often don’t have the data we actually want or need.” (From weallcount.com)

When you can’t directly measure the data you need, choose the best available proxy.

- GDP for standard of living
- NOT recessions for tightness of the labor market, since the unemployment rate is a better proxy

## Distinguish between types of variables

- ordinal categorical variables
- nominal categorical variables
- continuous variables on an interval scale
  - a measure that has a numerical value and the magnitude between the intervals is the same
- continuous variables on a ratio scale
  - a measure that is the same as an interval measure, but it also has a true zero value (a complete absence of what is being measured)

Table 6.1 on page 76 of Daniels & Minot is your best friend

Open Github\\exercises\\Daniels_Minot_data\\College Results.dta

• Can you find one example of each type of variable? See Table 6.1
• `label list` command is helpful

### Visualizing Variable Types

Exercise: Make appropriate use of bar graphs and histograms.

With College Results.dta open:

- `graph bar (count), over(atsp)`
  - Now try it with the “AvgNetPriceAfterGrants” variable
  - What’s going on? Use `codebook` command
- `histogram AvgNetPriceAfterGrants, percent`
  - Change the number of “bins”:
  - `histogram AvgNetPriceAfterGrants, bin(10) percent`
- What graph type would you use for variable “Size3”?
- Can you produce at least one histogram or bar chart for your project data?
