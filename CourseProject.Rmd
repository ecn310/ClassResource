## Teamwork and team dynamics

### Building the team contract


In your project teams:

- Discuss your thoughts on the team contract examples on Blackboard under “Content” tab
- Record your preliminary thoughts on the new issue (from
last slide)
-  Soon, you’ll create an .md file in your team’s project repo (a single contract for the whole team) called team_contract.md
- You will also finalize the contract on Wednesday
- You can start drafting the .md file today if you want to explore. If you do, link to the .md file in your new issue

### Project Team Check-Ins

Someone creates a Discussion on your team’s Github repo

- Name it “*Month Day* Team Check-in”.
- Make sure to link to it in your project log for today
  - Each member: add a comment with three bullets:
  - Something someone did to help the team this week: ___
  - Something I could have done better for the team this week: ____
  - An area/suggestion for team improvement: ____
- As a group: discuss the posts
- It’s fair to point out something someone did/didn’t do that they didn’t include at this point, but you must state it in “I” terms
- Someone replies in a new comment at the end to summarize your discussion
- Where is your team in the storming/norming/performing stages?
- You can revise your team contract as long as each team member agrees and signs via a Github commit


## Project Data Check-In

You will have to write documenation for your team's project data that will include...

- Short description of the data
  - Includes number of variables, number of observations for each data set (you may have more than one data set)
- Explanation of where the data comes from / how someone can acquire it / where you have stored it
- List of key variables you may use for testing your hypothesis
  - How you will link different data sets together if necessary

You will need to answer...

Has our team already accessed all the data we need?

- (If not) Do we have a plan to access it?
- (If not) What do we need to be able to make a plan?

### Documentation Check Feedback

Clearly state in your documentation which person is primarily responsible for each task (or subtask)

- It's okay to say that one person is in charge of filling in Section 2 while another is in charge of filling in Section 3
- Another good reason to assign backups: the backup can be responsible for checking to make sure the work got done

Each person (or group of people) who does work on a task should...

1. post on that task’s issue with the details
- E.g., I revised the causal diagram for paper 4 in this commit
2. Post on the group’s “daily log”
- E.g., I worked on the paper summary task #7
 One group log said "Discussed data sets and the disconnect between the two“
- Good, but if Prof. Buzard can't see the details of what you've decidedv and/or done, she can't support you in getting to the end product you're going to need to do your analysis.
- Great examples of detailed task documentation [here](https://github.com/ecn310/course-project-tariffs/issues/7#issuecomment-3418117107) and [here](https://github.com/ecn310/course-project-tariffs/issues/5#issuecomment-3417294062).

## Putting Together Your Data Set

Learning objectives (Greenlaw Ch. 9, pp. 160-163):

1. Develop a search strategy for finding your data (applies even if you have a dataset recommended by a faculty member)
2. Obtain data that correctly measure the concepts that your theory deems important

**Develop a search strategy for finding your data:**

In order to find data that correctly measure the concepts that your theory deems important,

- START by reviewing your theoretical model.
- ask, “What variables do I need data for to test my research hypothesis?”
- rethink your hypothesis if you can’t answer the question, “If I could obtain ideal data, what variables would they include?”

Greenlaw Ch. 9 assumes you already have your hypothesis.

- We’ll use its ideas to help you reverse-engineer a hypothesis if necessary
- To start: What variables do you have that are related to the research question?

Obtain data that correctly measure the concepts that your theory deems important. Which question should you ask as you investigate a data source?

- What data are, in fact, available?
- If the data are not good enough, are they good enough?
- If the data are not acceptable and there is no adequate **proxy**, how can the hypothesis be reformulated to make it testable, given the data available?

Proxy: a variable that substitutes for another unavailable or unobserved variable (R&vR p. 113)

- This is needed when it’s too difficult or costly to directly quantify the ideal variable, or the ideal variable is not included in available datasets


### Proxy Variables

“Proxy variables are data that we hope captures the quantitative essence of a thing without actually measuring a thing. They are used a lot in data projects, mostly because we often don’t have the data we actually want or need.” (From weallcount.com)

When you can’t directly measure the data you need, choose the best available proxy.

- GDP for standard of living
- NOT recessions for tightness of the labor market, since the unemployment rate is a better proxy

## Using Writing as a Tool for Economic Research

Learning objectives

1. Construct arguments that are well supported, logical, and hierarchical
2. Ensure that your conclusions follow from your evidence
3. List the desirable characteristics of evidence

The purpose of scholarly writing is to make an argument that is persuasive to experts in the field.

- For an argument to be persuasive the reasons supporting it must be true, and the conclusion must follow from those reasons.


### Final Project Report Sections

Pull Github updates to your Overleaf team repo (1 person!) project_template.tex outlines the typical sections you should have (others are possible)

- Abstract
- Intro 
- Lit review 
- Theory / Hypothesis (can be in intro or separate section)
- Data 
- Results
- Discussion
- Conclusion
- References / Bibliography 

### Sketch of to-do list (mostly in order)

1. Working hypothesis with data needs specified
2. Manipulate data into the form you need
3. Run summary stats
4. Run correlations, hypothesis tests, etc.; confirm “story”
5. Write up Theory / Hypothesis
6. Write up Data, Results, Discussion sections
7. Finalize Reproducibility Package / Data Appendix
8. Expand and finalize Lit Review, References
9. Finalize Intro and Conclusion
10. Write Abstract

### Communicating the results of a research project:

Greenlaw Ch. 12 Learning Objectives:

1. Describe the purpose of a research report
2. Describe how you tested your hypothesis and what you found

Write introduction last!

- For now, focus on getting your working hypothesis nailed down and your data ready to test it
– Until you see the basic story that is embedded in your data, you don't really have enough to go on to even start the intro
- Results (aka empirical analysis) section
  - the type of statistical analysis you employed
  - the results you hypothesized
  - your actual results
  - your interpretation of the results.

## Reproducibility Package

- Raw data
  - should not be modified in any way;
  - should contain all observations originally collected in a widely accessible format, with a data codebook describing all variables;
  - should have documentation about the collection of the data, such as API script or step-by-step instructions, in EXCRUCIATING detail;
- Code
  - all code required to derive analysis data from downloaded data;
  - all code required to reproduce research outputs from analysis data;
- Research outputs (graphs, tables, etc)
- README (master documentation)
  - should explain the use and structure of the code, including
  - any intermediate datasets
  - location and how to access all files, including figures

Examples [here](https://github.com/ecn310/course-project-nepobabies/blob/main/Final%20Report/ReproducibilityPackage.md), [here](https://github.com/ecn310/course-project-zipcentercrime/tree/main/Reproducibility%20Package), and [here](https://github.com/ecn310/course-project-accidentsteam/tree/main/Reproducibility%20Package).

## Descriptive Statistics

Learning objectives ([Daniels & Minot](https://research.ebsco.com/c/gvriom/search/details/qcsbnwmqtn?db=nlebk), pp. 75-80 and 96-101):

1. List the uses for descriptive statistics in research.
2. Distinguish between ordinal categorical variables, nominal categorical variables, continuous variables on an interval scale, and continuous variables on a ratio scale.
3. Include the number of missing values in a frequency table and think critically about which values are missing.
4. Make appropriate use of bar graphs and histograms.

## Distinguish between types of variables

- ordinal categorical variables
- nominal categorical variables
- continuous variables on an interval scale
  - a measure that has a numerical value and the magnitude between the intervals is the same
- continuous variables on a ratio scale
  - a measure that is the same as an interval measure, but it also has a true zero value (a complete absence of what is being measured)

Table 6.1 on page 76 of Daniels & Minot is your best friend

Open Github\\exercises\\Daniels_Minot_data\\College Results.dta

• Can you find one example of each type of variable? See Table 6.1
• `label list` command is helpful

### Visualizing Variable Types

Exercise: Make appropriate use of bar graphs and histograms.

With College Results.dta open:

- `graph bar (count), over(atsp)`
  - Now try it with the “AvgNetPriceAfterGrants” variable
  - What’s going on? Use `codebook` command
- `histogram AvgNetPriceAfterGrants, percent`
  - Change the number of “bins”:
  - `histogram AvgNetPriceAfterGrants, bin(10) percent`
- What graph type would you use for variable “Size3”?
- Can you produce at least one histogram or bar chart for your project data?
