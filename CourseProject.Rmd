## Teamwork and team dynamics

### Building the team contract


In your project teams:

- Discuss your thoughts on the team contract examples on Blackboard under “Content” tab
- Record your preliminary thoughts on the new issue (from
last slide)
-  Soon, you’ll create an .md file in your team’s project repo (a single contract for the whole team) called team_contract.md
- You will also finalize the contract on Wednesday
- You can start drafting the .md file today if you want to explore. If you do, link to the .md file in your new issue

### Project Team Check-Ins

Someone creates a Discussion on your team’s Github repo

– Name it “*Month Day* Team Check-in”.
– Make sure to link to it in your project log for today
  - Each member: add a comment with three bullets:
  - Something someone did to help the team this week: ___
  - Something I could have done better for the team this week: ____
  - An area/suggestion for team improvement: ____
- As a group: discuss the posts
- It’s fair to point out something someone did/didn’t do that they didn’t include at this point, but you must state it in “I” terms
- Someone replies in a new comment at the end to summarize your discussion
- Where is your team in the storming/norming/performing stages?
- You can revise your team contract as long as each team member agrees and signs via a Github commit


## Project Data Check-In

You will have to write documenation for your team's project data that will include...

- Short description of the data
  - Includes number of variables, number of observations for each data set (you may have more than one data set)
- Explanation of where the data comes from / how someone can acquire it / where you have stored it
- List of key variables you may use for testing your hypothesis
  - How you will link different data sets together if necessary

You will need to answer...

Has our team already accessed all the data we need?

- (If not) Do we have a plan to access it?
- (If not) What do we need to be able to make a plan?
