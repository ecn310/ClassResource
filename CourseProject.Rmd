## Team Contract

### Step 1

In your project teams:

- Discuss your thoughts on the team contract examples on Blackboard under “Content” tab
- Record your preliminary thoughts on the new issue (from
last slide)
-  Soon, you’ll create an .md file in your team’s project repo (a single contract for the whole team) called team_contract.md
- You will also finalize the contract on Wednesday
- You can start drafting the .md file today if you want to explore. If you do, link to the .md file in your new issue
