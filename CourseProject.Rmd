## Teamwork and team dynamics

### Building the team contract


In your project teams:

- Discuss your thoughts on the team contract examples on Blackboard under “Content” tab
- Record your preliminary thoughts on the new issue (from
last slide)
-  Soon, you’ll create an .md file in your team’s project repo (a single contract for the whole team) called team_contract.md
- You will also finalize the contract on Wednesday
- You can start drafting the .md file today if you want to explore. If you do, link to the .md file in your new issue

### Project Team Check-Ins

Someone creates a Discussion on your team’s Github repo

– Name it “*Month Day* Team Check-in”.
– Make sure to link to it in your project log for today
  - Each member: add a comment with three bullets:
  - Something someone did to help the team this week: ___
  - Something I could have done better for the team this week: ____
  - An area/suggestion for team improvement: ____
- As a group: discuss the posts
- It’s fair to point out something someone did/didn’t do that they didn’t include at this point, but you must state it in “I” terms
- Someone replies in a new comment at the end to summarize your discussion
- Where is your team in the storming/norming/performing stages?
- You can revise your team contract as long as each team member agrees and signs via a Github commit


## Project Data Check-In

You will have to write documenation for your team's project data that will include...

- Short description of the data
  - Includes number of variables, number of observations for each data set (you may have more than one data set)
- Explanation of where the data comes from / how someone can acquire it / where you have stored it
- List of key variables you may use for testing your hypothesis
  - How you will link different data sets together if necessary

You will need to answer...

Has our team already accessed all the data we need?

- (If not) Do we have a plan to access it?
- (If not) What do we need to be able to make a plan?

### Documentation Check Feedback

Clearly state in your documentation which person is primarily responsible for each task (or subtask)

- It's okay to say that one person is in charge of filling in Section 2 while another is in charge of filling in Section 3
- Another good reason to assign backups: the backup can be responsible for checking to make sure the work got done

## Putting Together Your Data Set

Learning objectives (Greenlaw Ch. 9, pp. 160-163):
1. Develop a search strategy for finding your data (applies even if you have a dataset recommended by a faculty member)
2. Obtain data that correctly measure the concepts that your theory deems important

**Develop a search strategy for finding your data:**

In order to find data that correctly measure the concepts that your theory deems important,

- START by reviewing your theoretical model.
- ask, “What variables do I need data for to test my research hypothesis?”
- rethink your hypothesis if you can’t answer the question, “If I could obtain ideal data, what variables would they include?”

Greenlaw Ch. 9 assumes you already have your hypothesis.

- We’ll use its ideas to help you reverse-engineer a hypothesis if necessary
- To start: What variables do you have that are related to the research question?

Obtain data that correctly measure the concepts that your theory deems important. Which question should you ask as you investigate a data source?
- What data are, in fact, available?
- If the data are not good enough, are they good enough?
- If the data are not acceptable and there is no adequate **proxy**, how can the hypothesis be reformulated to make it testable, given the data available?

Proxy: a variable that substitutes for another unavailable or unobserved variable (R&vR p. 113)

- This is needed when it’s too difficult or costly to directly quantify the ideal variable, or the ideal variable is not included in available datasets
