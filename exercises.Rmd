## GSS Mini Report

**Task**

Working in your “GSS Mini Research Report Team”:

1.  Pick one variable from the 2016 General Social Survey (GSS2016.dta) that makes sense in a pie chart
2.  Enter the variable name in PollEverywhere

-   Your team’s variable must be unique
-   Both team members should submit it

3.  Make the pie chart in Stata
4.  Save it wherever you want on your computer, as .png or .jpg (NOT as a Stata graph—nothing except Stata can open those)
5.  Go to the “First (mini) research report” issue on the exercises repo, <https://github.com/ecn310/exercises/discussions/4>
6.  Write and submit your report on the Github discussion

-   One report per team
-   Instructions are in the first post
-   I’ll put an example in the first comment on the issue

**How to access and analyze the data**

1.  Navigate to the exercises repo on Github
2.  In the list toward the left of the screen, click on GSS2016.dta
3.  Click on "View raw" or the download symbol all the way on the right of the gray "Code" bar
4.  Save the file to your computer, noting the location you save it to
5.  Navigate to where you saved the file and double-click on it (this only opens Stata because it’s a .dta)
6.  Explore the data in Stata. Use `browse` to see the data, use `describe` or `describe, short` to get a summary of the data file.
7.  Explore one variable by using `codebook varname`, where you input the name of your variable where "varname" is to get an understanding of your variable. Use `tabulate varname` to see what the observations for that variable look like.

**Make a pie graph**

-   Use `graph pie, over(worryjob)` to make a pie chart.

    -   Use `help graph pie` to view documentation on the `graph pie` command.

-   Use `graph pie, over(worryjob) title("How many people worry about losing their job?")` to add a title.

-   Use `graph pie, over(worryjob) title("How many people worry about losing their job?") plabel(_all percent)`to add percentages

-   Finally, use `graph export "C:\Users\...\pie_worryjob.png",as(png), replace` to save the graph as an image file. Ensure that you fill in the “…” to match the file path on your computer.

**Understand and apply syntax for saving a file**

-   `graph export` is the command to save a graph
-   `"C:\Users\krist\OneDrive - Syracuse University\ECN_310\pie_worryjob.png"` is the path and file name ON PROFESSOR BUZARD’S COMPUTER, not on yours! You need to customize!
-   `,` is the required comma between command and options
-   `as(png)` is the option that saves the file in PNG format
-   `replace` is the option to write over any existing file in the same location with the same name
