If you do, link to the .md file in your new issue 3.1.2 Project Team Check-Ins Someone creates a Discussion on your team’s Github repo Name it “Month Day Team Check-in”. Make sure to link to it in your project log for today Each member: add a comment with three bullets: Something someone did to help the team this week: ___ Something I could have done better for the team this week: ____ An area/suggestion for team improvement: ____ As a group: discuss the posts It’s fair to point out something someone did/didn’t do that they didn’t include at this point, but you must state it in “I” terms Someone replies in a new comment at the end to summarize your discussion Where is your team in the storming/norming/performing stages? You can revise your team contract as long as each team member agrees and signs via a Github commit 3.2 Project Data Check-In You will have to write documenation for your team’s project data that will include… Short description of the data Includes number of variables, number of observations for each data set (you may have more than one data set) Explanation of where the data comes from / how someone can acquire it / where you have stored it List of key variables you may use for testing your hypothesis How you will link different data sets together if necessary You will need to answer… Has our team already accessed all the data we need? (If not) Do we have a plan to access it? (If not) What do we need to be able to make a plan? 3.2.1 Documentation Check Feedback Clearly state in your documentation which person is primarily responsible for each task (or subtask) It’s okay to say that one person is in charge of filling in Section 2 while another is in charge of filling in Section 3 Another good reason to assign backups: the backup can be responsible for checking to make sure the work got done Each person (or group of people) who does work on a task should… post on that task’s issue with the details E.g., I revised the causal diagram for paper 4 in this commit Post on the group’s “daily log” E.g., I worked on the paper summary task #7 One group log said “Discussed data sets and the disconnect between the two“ Good, but if Prof. Buzard can’t see the details of what you’ve decidedv and/or done, she can’t support you in getting to the end product you’re going to need to do your analysis. Great examples of detailed task documentation here and here. 3.3 Putting Together Your Data Set Learning objectives (Greenlaw Ch. 9, pp. 160-163): Develop a search strategy for finding your data (applies even if you have a dataset recommended by a faculty member) Obtain data that correctly measure the concepts that your theory deems important Develop a search strategy for finding your data: In order to find data that correctly measure the concepts that your theory deems important, START by reviewing your theoretical model. ask, “What variables do I need data for to test my research hypothesis?” rethink your hypothesis if you can’t answer the question, “If I could obtain ideal data, what variables would they include?” Greenlaw Ch. 9 assumes you already have your hypothesis. We’ll use its ideas to help you reverse-engineer a hypothesis if necessary To start: What variables do you have that are related to the research question? Obtain data that correctly measure the concepts that your theory deems important. Which question should you ask as you investigate a data source? What data are, in fact, available? If the data are not good enough, are they good enough? If the data are not acceptable and there is no adequate proxy, how can the hypothesis be reformulated to make it testable, given the data available? Proxy: a variable that substitutes for another unavailable or unobserved variable (R&amp;vR p. 113) This is needed when it’s too difficult or costly to directly quantify the ideal variable, or the ideal variable is not included in available datasets 3.3.1 Proxy Variables “Proxy variables are data that we hope captures the quantitative essence of a thing without actually measuring a thing. They are used a lot in data projects, mostly because we often don’t have the data we actually want or need.” (From weallcount.com) When you can’t directly measure the data you need, choose the best available proxy. GDP for standard of living NOT recessions for tightness of the labor market, since the unemployment rate is a better proxy 3.4 Using Writing as a Tool for Economic Research Learning objectives Construct arguments that are well supported, logical, and hierarchical Ensure that your conclusions follow from your evidence List the desirable characteristics of evidence The purpose of scholarly writing is to make an argument that is persuasive to experts in the field. For an argument to be persuasive the reasons supporting it must be true, and the conclusion must follow from those reasons. 3.5 Final Project Report Pull Github updates to your Overleaf team repo (1 person!) project_template.tex outlines the typical sections you should have (others are possible) Abstract Intro Lit review Theory / Hypothesis (can be in intro or separate section) Data Results Discussion Conclusion References / Bibliography 3.5.1 Sketch of to-do list (mostly in order) Working hypothesis with data needs specified Manipulate data into the form you need Run summary stats Run correlations, hypothesis tests, etc.; confirm “story” Write up Theory / Hypothesis Write up Data, Results, Discussion sections Finalize Reproducibility Package / Data Appendix Expand and finalize Lit Review, References Finalize Intro and Conclusion Write Abstract 3.6 Reproducibility Package Raw data should not be modified in any way; should contain all observations originally collected in a widely accessible format, with a data codebook describing all variables; should have documentation about the collection of the data, such as API script or step-by-step instructions, in EXCRUCIATING detail; Code all code required to derive analysis data from downloaded data; all code required to reproduce research outputs from analysis data; Research outputs (graphs, tables, etc) README (master documentation) should explain the use and structure of the code, including any intermediate datasets location and how to access all files, including figures Examples here, here, and here.
