If you do, link to the .md file in your new issue 3.1.2 Project Team Check-Ins Someone creates a Discussion on your team’s Github repo Name it “Month Day Team Check-in”. Make sure to link to it in your project log for today Each member: add a comment with three bullets: Something someone did to help the team this week: ___ Something I could have done better for the team this week: ____ An area/suggestion for team improvement: ____ As a group: discuss the posts It’s fair to point out something someone did/didn’t do that they didn’t include at this point, but you must state it in “I” terms Someone replies in a new comment at the end to summarize your discussion Where is your team in the storming/norming/performing stages? You can revise your team contract as long as each team member agrees and signs via a Github commit 3.1.3 Documentation Check Feedback Clearly state in your documentation which person is primarily responsible for each task (or subtask) It’s okay to say that one person is in charge of filling in Section 2 while another is in charge of filling in Section 3 Another good reason to assign backups: the backup can be responsible for checking to make sure the work got done Each person (or group of people) who does work on a task should… post on that task’s issue with the details E.g., I revised the causal diagram for paper 4 in this commit Post on the group’s “daily log” E.g., I worked on the paper summary task #7 One group log said “Discussed data sets and the disconnect between the two“ Good, but if Prof. Buzard can’t see the details of what you’ve decidedv and/or done, she can’t support you in getting to the end product you’re going to need to do your analysis. Great examples of detailed task documentation here and here. 3.2 Using Writing as a Tool for Economic Research Learning objectives Construct arguments that are well supported, logical, and hierarchical Ensure that your conclusions follow from your evidence List the desirable characteristics of evidence The purpose of scholarly writing is to make an argument that is persuasive to experts in the field. For an argument to be persuasive the reasons supporting it must be true, and the conclusion must follow from those reasons. 3.2.1 Writing as a Product of Economic Analysis Learning objectives (Greenlaw Ch. 5): Articulate what is required when ‘writing as product’ Your audience is your sponsoring professor and other academic economists Your writing should be formal, clear, include sufficient (but not too many) details Describe how experienced writers allocate their time between the writing steps You should spend the most time on pre-writing and revising List the five features of good economic writing Understand the importance of writing the first draft quickly (different from soon) You’re not going to write the first draft of the whole report all at once Data section first, then results Avoid plagiarism Realize your project’s potential by leaving time to revise and edit You forego substantial improvements if you only write one draft One of the most disappointing comments to write on students’ final papers is “This would make an excellent first draft.” In other words, it has great potential but that potential was not realized. 3.2.2 Final Project Report Sections Pull Github updates to your Overleaf team repo (1 person!) project_template.tex outlines the typical sections you should have (others are possible) Abstract Intro Lit review Theory / Hypothesis (can be in intro or separate section) Data Results Discussion Conclusion References / Bibliography 3.2.3 Sketch of to-do list (mostly in order) Working hypothesis with data needs specified Manipulate data into the form you need Run summary stats Run correlations, hypothesis tests, etc.; confirm “story” Write up Theory / Hypothesis Write up Data, Results, Discussion sections Finalize Reproducibility Package / Data Appendix Expand and finalize Lit Review, References Finalize Intro and Conclusion Write Abstract 3.2.4 Communicating the results of a research project: Greenlaw Ch. 12 Learning Objectives: Describe the purpose of a research report Describe how you tested your hypothesis and what you found Write introduction last! For now, focus on getting your working hypothesis nailed down and your data ready to test it – Until you see the basic story that is embedded in your data, you don’t really have enough to go on to even start the intro Results (aka empirical analysis) section the type of statistical analysis you employed the results you hypothesized your actual results your interpretation of the results. 3.3 Reproducibility Package Raw data should not be modified in any way; should contain all observations originally collected in a widely accessible format, with a data codebook describing all variables; should have documentation about the collection of the data, such as API script or step-by-step instructions, in EXCRUCIATING detail; Code all code required to derive analysis data from downloaded data; all code required to reproduce research outputs from analysis data; Research outputs (graphs, tables, etc) README (master documentation) should explain the use and structure of the code, including any intermediate datasets location and how to access all files, including figures What details do you need to write down? Ask yourself: What does Professor Buzard need so she can understand exactly what we did and give us feedback? What information do we need to write down so we can remember it clearly tomorrow, next week, or when we’re writing the report? Can be in a commit (show SHA), issue or discussion post, a file, etc. Example from hypothesis workshop Where the details live… Detailed documentation should be linked in your master file &amp; your log Code (do-files if working in Stata) Must be thoroughly commented Task documentation I suggest Issues on Github (example here), but you can choose the location 3.3.1 Reproducibility Package Ideas Example on Github from World Bank World Bank e-book This section on output in particular Great summary in this table specifically about the reproducibility package This goes along with the example above Feodora Teti’s Comprehensive README You can have something like this all in one document if your project is simple enough You should give a little bit of an introduction, like the main page of the World Bank example Examples from previous projects here, here, and here. 3.3.2 Reproducibility package plan You can put your plan wherever it makes sense to your team, just say where it is in your log and master documentation List all the pieces that your project requires in a plan that says where each piece will be stored and how each piece will relate to the whole Github? OneDrive if any one dataset is over 50mb Can it all go in a data appendix? Do you need several documents? Are all the files in one folder, or many? Create a timeline of the tasks required to get the reproducibility package (and underlying work) completed It should dovetail with your final submission plan (which you should be updating frequently) Make sure you include time to ensure do-files are well-commented Examples here and here 3.3.3 Master documentation file This is a critical piece of the reproducibility package. It will encompass and contain information on every piece of your project. Navigate to the main page for your project repo and click “Add a README” at the bottom Create the document the same as you would for any .md file on Github Include links to all the various pieces of your project (team contract, data, .do files, data.tex file, literature, notes, code, etc.). Anything you’ve created (and not deleted) for the project should show up here as a link It will be updated each week for anything new you create or major decisions you make Explain what every file in your Github repo does (this is a good time to prune your files if needed) Examples here, here, here, and here 3.3.4 Full credit standard for project documentation All analysis is easily and fully reproduced using supplied materials. Documentation / reproducibility package is logically organized. Integrates data work into a coherent whole that the reader can easily follow. Tell a coherent, complete story in the documentation! All steps, including each line (or small group of lines) of code in each do-file, are clearly explained. Key choices (e.g., how to deal with outliers) are well justified. Some of this may be in report, some only in documentation If in report, just point to that in documentation instead of repeating All sentences are complete and grammatical (or in bullet point form). All words are chosen for their precise meanings. Key concepts are completely explained. Submission has been spell-checked and proofread and has no errors. 3.4 Rubric Here is the rubric for your final submission of the course project, including the final report and the reproducibility package.
