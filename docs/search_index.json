Remler &amp; Van Ryzin’s definition: “A social and intellectual activity that involves systematic inquiry aimed at accurately describing and explaining the world” Primary research (our focus), aims to establish new facts and reach new conclusions to create knowledge That is, it pushes out the frontier of what is already known It is heavily influenced by the perspectives of the researcher The process of research… involves the collection, organization, and analysis of information is fundamentally creative requires critical thinking is iterative, non-linear, less straightforward than a lot of coursework is a social and intellectual activity that involves systematic inquiry aimed at accurately describing and explaining the world.

If you do, link to the .md file in your new issue 3.1.2 Project Team Check-Ins Someone creates a Discussion on your team’s Github repo Name it “Month Day Team Check-in”. Make sure to link to it in your project log for today Each member: add a comment with three bullets: Something someone did to help the team this week: ___ Something I could have done better for the team this week: ____ An area/suggestion for team improvement: ____ As a group: discuss the posts It’s fair to point out something someone did/didn’t do that they didn’t include at this point, but you must state it in “I” terms Someone replies in a new comment at the end to summarize your discussion Where is your team in the storming/norming/performing stages? You can revise your team contract as long as each team member agrees and signs via a Github commit 3.1.3 Documentation Check Feedback Clearly state in your documentation which person is primarily responsible for each task (or subtask) It’s okay to say that one person is in charge of filling in Section 2 while another is in charge of filling in Section 3 Another good reason to assign backups: the backup can be responsible for checking to make sure the work got done Each person (or group of people) who does work on a task should… post on that task’s issue with the details E.g., I revised the causal diagram for paper 4 in this commit Post on the group’s “daily log” E.g., I worked on the paper summary task #7 One group log said “Discussed data sets and the disconnect between the two“ Good, but if Prof. Buzard can’t see the details of what you’ve decidedv and/or done, she can’t support you in getting to the end product you’re going to need to do your analysis. Great examples of detailed task documentation here and here. 3.1.4 Documentation Structure Professor Buzard will look at the data and results sections holistically with data appendix and reproducibility package When in doubt about whether to include data details in your report vs the data appendix/reproducibility package, ask for guidance You should NOT explain exactly how you coded things in the report; just say what you did in plain English, e.g. “We merged dataset1 with dataset2 using the XYZ variable.” This is flexible: depends on your project and on your preferences Your instructions for the reproducibility package will be the README on your reproducibility package folder if you have one, or reproducibility.md in your main folder Store analysis outputs in a folder on Github, so you can pull them (and link directly to them) into Overleaf 3.1.5 Sketch of to-do list (mostly in order) Working hypothesis with data needs specified Manipulate data into the form you need Run summary stats Run correlations, hypothesis tests, etc.; confirm “story” Write up Theory / Hypothesis Write up Data, Results, Discussion sections Finalize Reproducibility Package / Data Appendix Expand and finalize Lit Review, References Finalize Intro and Conclusion Write Abstract 3.2 Reproducibility Package Raw data should not be modified in any way; should contain all observations originally collected in a widely accessible format, with a data codebook describing all variables; should have documentation about the collection of the data, such as API script or step-by-step instructions, in EXCRUCIATING detail; Code all code required to derive analysis data from downloaded data; all code required to reproduce research outputs from analysis data; Research outputs (graphs, tables, etc) README (master documentation) should explain the use and structure of the code, including any intermediate datasets location and how to access all files, including figures What details do you need to write down? Ask yourself: What does Professor Buzard need so she can understand exactly what we did and give us feedback? What information do we need to write down so we can remember it clearly tomorrow, next week, or when we’re writing the report? Can be in a commit (show SHA), issue or discussion post, a file, etc. Example from hypothesis workshop Where the details live… Detailed documentation should be linked in your master file &amp; your log Code (do-files if working in Stata) Must be thoroughly commented Task documentation I suggest Issues on Github (example here), but you can choose the location 3.2.1 Reproducibility Package Ideas Example on Github from World Bank World Bank e-book This section on output in particular Great summary in this table specifically about the reproducibility package This goes along with the example above Feodora Teti’s Comprehensive README You can have something like this all in one document if your project is simple enough You should give a little bit of an introduction, like the main page of the World Bank example Examples from previous projects here, here, and here. 3.2.2 Reproducibility package plan You can put your plan wherever it makes sense to your team, just say where it is in your log and master documentation List all the pieces that your project requires in a plan that says where each piece will be stored and how each piece will relate to the whole Github? OneDrive if any one dataset is over 50mb Can it all go in a data appendix? Do you need several documents? Are all the files in one folder, or many? Create a timeline of the tasks required to get the reproducibility package (and underlying work) completed It should dovetail with your final submission plan (which you should be updating frequently) Make sure you include time to ensure do-files are well-commented Examples here and here 3.2.3 Reproducible Research Requirements You can refer to the World Bank’s research handbook to obtain an understanding of these, as well. Raw data should: not be modified in any way; contain all observations originally collected in a widely accessible format, with a data codebook describing all variables; have original documentation about the collection of the data, such as API script or step-by-step instructions, in EXCRUCIATING detail; Raw data to research outputs section should contain all code required to derive analysis data from downloaded data; all code required to reproduce research outputs from analysis data; a README with documentation on the use and structure of the code; should explain any intermediate datasets should give location and how to access all files, including figures The research report should be written and maintained as a dynamic LaTeX file be written in Overleaf i. .tex file can be pushed to Github from Overleaf ii. You’ll have to download the PDF from Overleaf and upload to Github once the report is final; [in a Data Appendix] contain instructions about where to find / how to access your reproducibility package (all your documentation, data and code); be recompiled with all final figures, tables, and other code outputs before submission. 3.2.4 Master documentation file This is a critical piece of the reproducibility package. It will encompass and contain information on every piece of your project. Navigate to the main page for your project repo and click “Add a README” at the bottom Create the document the same as you would for any .md file on Github Include links to all the various pieces of your project (team contract, data, .do files, data.tex file, literature, notes, code, etc.). Anything you’ve created (and not deleted) for the project should show up here as a link It will be updated each week for anything new you create or major decisions you make Explain what every file in your Github repo does (this is a good time to prune your files if needed) Organize it by topic: keep everything related to data together, everything related to literature together, etc. Examples here, here, here, and here 3.2.5 Full credit standard for project documentation All analysis is easily and fully reproduced using supplied materials. Documentation / reproducibility package is logically organized. Integrates data work into a coherent whole that the reader can easily follow. Tell a coherent, complete story in the documentation! All steps, including each line (or small group of lines) of code in each do-file, are clearly explained. Key choices (e.g., how to deal with outliers) are well justified. Some of this may be in report, some only in documentation If in report, just point to that in documentation instead of repeating All sentences are complete and grammatical (or in bullet point form). All words are chosen for their precise meanings. Key concepts are completely explained. Submission has been spell-checked and proofread and has no errors. 3.3 Project Terminology Reproducibility is a concept Good documentation helps make a project reproducible You create a reproducibility package to facilitate reproducibility Literature review You’ve done pre-work via your paper summaries Analysis is a general term for your statistical work Results is the title of the section of the report that talks about your analysis and what you learn from it Observations vs. variables Observations represent the units of data that you have, like firms or people or counties. Variables are the things that you have data for each observation, e.g., a firm’s revenue, a person’s age, etc. LaTeX is the markup language we use in Overleaf Overleaf is an online app that organizes and compiles LaTeX code You can have many different LaTeX (.tex) files in Overleaf Comments: % in LaTeX (# in R, * in Stata) 3.4 Presentations 3.4.1 Preliminary Results 3-5 minute presentation on Working hypothesis Null hypothesis Data you use to test null hypothesis Descriptive stats on each variable plus relationship between them (testing your hypothesis) Include all the figures, statistics, and tables that you plan to put in your report Then workshop / feedback You can put everything into the results section of your project report (.tex in Overleaf), a Github discussion, or PowerPoint/Google Slides/etc. 3.4.2 Full Presentations Also like a workshop, lasts 5-7 minutes. It must include… Research question, hypothesis, null hypothesis, theory Your data: where it comes from, summary stats for all the variables you’re using Probably graphs to give context Your analysis: tests of your hypothesis, anything else that’s needed to explain why this is the right test or to tell your story Include all the figures, statistics, and tables that you plan to put in your final report Same presentation formats acceptable as for the preliminary results presentations 3.5 Rubric Here is the rubric for your final submission of the course project, including the final report and the reproducibility package. 3.6 AI Disclosure Statements The AI disclosure statement is for the purposes of our coursework, so it belongs on the relevant Github issue, NOT in the report Be very clear about what work you’re talking about “AI Disclosure Statement: No artificial intelligence was used in the process of creating this work.” What is “this work”? On a Github issue, this might only apply to the single post it’s attached to Be detailed about what you use AI for: helping you to code, writing your code (don’t!), proofreading, troubleshoot your graphs, improving organization, etc. It’s fine to use no AI in a given assignment, but your proofreading has to come from somewhere I use Claude or ChatGPT to troubleshoot LaTeX compilation errors (full credit requires that your .tex file has zero compilation errors) "],["github.html", "Section 4 GitHub 4.1 Collaboration &amp; Documentation on Github 4.2 GitHub Desktop 4.3 Synching to GitHub Desktop Exercise 4.4 Organizing Data and Files on Project Repo", " Section 4 GitHub 4.1 Collaboration &amp; Documentation on Github Using comments/notifications/commits for collaboration In general, you have to “mention” (@username) someone for them to get a notification You can mention individuals or a whole team If you edit a comment, a notification isn’t usually sent When you make a change in response to someone’s comment, mention people (@username) who need to know in a new comment Use “blame” feature to figure out where to leave a comment on a file Use detailed commit messages so your teammates know what you’ve accomplished Also make sure to report it in your project log (linking to output whenever possible) Use preview before committing so you have fewer commits (avoids formatting errors, obvious mistakes) It’s going to work best to have your work product in an .md file, .do file, discussion or issue Then you can just link to each piece from your documentation Your log is your only documentation for now Soon, we’ll start comprehensive documentation on Overleaf (LaTeX) A Google doc or similar is okay for early work as long as you link to it your documentation and the link is open access everything will be formalized into Overleaf soon 4.2 GitHub Desktop To create a folder to hold papers for your lit review, either Create the file using the Github UI (“user interface”— the web interface we’ve been using). Two ways to do it are described here Download Github desktop and use that interface (IMPORTANT: Do NOT just keep clicking if something doesn’t work—ask for help) Instructions are here to download Github desktop Click File, Clone Repository and enter URL of your repo Open Windows Explorer (window + E), navigate to “Local path” Create a folder called “Literature” with at least one paper in it in the local path commit it in Github desktop Click “Push origin” at top right Look at new commit and new folder on Github UI (website) Note: it is best to have your GitHub folders within OneDrive. 4.2.1 Syncing with Overleaf 4.3 Synching to GitHub Desktop Exercise Click on Current repository near the top left of Github Desktop. If exercises is in the list, click on it If exercises is NOT in the list but you think you cloned the exercises repo last Wednesday (that is, the folder is somewhere on your computer): Click File, click Add local repository, navigate to the folder, click Add repository Don’t give up too easily searching for it. 50% of Github problems come from accidentally downloading the same repo to multiple locations—do everything you can to avoid this If you didn’t clone the exercises repo yet: Click File, click Clone Repository, enter URL of your repo, choose where to save it (again, I suggest on OneDrive), click Clone Make sure your “current repository” is set to exercises and synch Leave “current branch” set to main Look at the box to the right of “current branch” It may say “Pull origin” or “Fetch origin” Regardless, click the button. Wait for Github Desktop to sync your files. If it doesn’t sync the first time, click the button one more time Once that third box says “Fetch origin; Last fetched just now”, click “History” toward the left of your screen This shows the same commit history as on the web interface Verify by clicking “View on Github” in the middle of the screen Click “Show in Explorer” in the middle of your screen This will show you all the files on your local computer, and they should match what you see on the web interface. Create a new .do file, save to local exercises repo Add just one line of text, something like “I’m going to upload this .do file to Github!” Add an asterisk at the beginning of the line; this will make it turn green—it’s a “comment” in the code Save the file as yourname.do (e.g., Ryan.do) in the push_to_Github folder in the exercises repo ON YOUR COMPUTER In Github Desktop, Changes on the left of the screen should now have a little “1” in a circle, and your file showing up below with a green plus sign next to it Use Github Desktop to upload a file In Github desktop: Write a commit message near the bottom left, in the line above “Description.” Make it something specific, like “Add Ryan’s .do file for push-to- Github assignment” You can leave the “Description” box blank—unless you need to add more detail to your commit message Click Commit to main Click Push origin Click View on Github Navigate to the Push_to_Github folder Verify that your “push” worked by clicking on your file name and viewing its contents. If it’s there and has a line of content, you’re done! 4.4 Organizing Data and Files on Project Repo Start by looking at previous project repos: Nepobabies Accidents Sometimes you feel like something is important to keep for later—that’s fine If you won’t need a file again (e.g., .zip file for schain that I asked to be replaced by .dta), delete it You can always go back into an earlier version of the repo to get things back if you get rid of them accidentally No need for “versioning” documents – Github always keeps the old versions To turn off notifications from a Github repo Go to the main page of the repo Click “Unwatch” toward the top right Choose “Ignore” Code Documentation Learning objectives (Slides 1-18 of PDF provided on Blackboard): Understand the role the code you write plays in a project, including for reproducibility and team dynamics. The research output is not just a paper or report, but whole process. That means code, data, documentation are just as important as the final text Articulate why you should use the Stata help files and reference manual. Valley of Hubris: your code doesn’t just need to run; it needs to produce what you intend to produce / what you tell others it produces Learn the structure and syntax of Stata help files. Demo (23 pages on merge alone!) Use the three types of comments to effectively document your code Types of Documentation For your project, you need all of the following: - “Daily” stream-of-consciousness log of work (you are already doing this!) - Task documentation - Keeps all the information about a task in the same place - Usually on an Issue on Github, sometimes Discussion (example here) - Code (do-files if working in Stata) - Must be thoroughly commented - A master documentation file - A master documentation file keeps track of where all the various pieces of your project are (data, literature, notes, code) - Example from a previous project for this course - You have started this on data.tex - Pieces of this will end up in your master documentation file – Master documentation should then be updated anytime anyone in your team creates something new or a major decision is made - For now, make sure to keep up with daily log, task documentation on Github issues, and keep updating data.tex - A master script - The research report "],["littheory.html", "Section 5 Literature Review and Economic Theory 5.1 Objectives 5.2 Finding Appropriate Papers 5.3 Appropriate Use of Artificial Intelligence for Literature Reviews 5.4 Paper Summaries 5.5 Theorizing", " Section 5 Literature Review and Economic Theory 5.1 Objectives Understand why and how researchers perform a literature review Distinguish between popular and scholarly literature Understand the usefulness of both browsing and keyword searching Note that your lit review will be relatively short and narrow compared to a literature review in a full paper. You’ll start with suggested papers from your faculty sponsor. 5.2 Finding Appropriate Papers The papers in your lit review should be scholarly economics papers, but how do you tell if it’s an economics paper? Look at journal or where working papers are posted Published economics papers will almost certainly be in journals on this list Look at authors’ websites. Does at least one author have a Ph.D in economics? Does at least one author work as a professor of economics or as an economist in some organization (government, think tank, etc)? Key Word Searching We don’t need a full-fledged search strategy because our faculty members have given us somewhere to start. However, different project teams will likely need to use different parts of the search strategies outlined in the book You’ll start by browsing the sources provided by your faculty sponsor These are already in your project’s Github repo Navigate to the discussion Prof. Buzard created on your team repo These will probably contain useful citations for you to follow up on You will also do a “forward citation” search Go to scholar.google.com (not in Greenlaw) and enter the title of one of the papers provided for your project Click “Cited by” for a list of other papers that cite this one Keyword search in JEP, JEL (page 34, Greenlaw) and EconLit (page 35, Greenlaw) will likely be useful to search in addition to Google Scholar 5.2.1 How to Make Sense of Published Research Learning objectives Acknowledge the challenges inherent in learning to read published research Explain the format of empirical research studies in economics Understand what is involved in evaluating the argument of an empirical paper Employ Greenlaw’s “Tips for Getting Through a Scholarly Journal Article.” Learn the basics of taking research notes and writing abstracts The format of an empirical research paper must include the following components: Introduction Sometimes there will be a separate section for lit review Analysis of the problem / theory / conceptual framework Sometimes there will NOT be a separate theory section Sometimes theory comes after empirics Empirical test Often results is separate from the framework/design; sometimes called something else (e.g., “results”) Conclusion Understand what is involved in evaluating the argument of an empirical paper: You don’t always need to go as in-depth in reading a paper as what Greenlaw describes. You consult different papers at different times for different purposes Employ Greenlaw’s “Tips for Getting Through a Scholarly Journal Article.” Skip almost all the math and statistics (econometrics) Most people with Ph.D.s will skip this for the vast majority of papers they “read” Learn the basics of taking research notes and writing abstracts: - Your speed and depth of reading should vary - It depends on what your goal is - For the first paper summary, focus mainly on the introduction to figure out what the research questions and hypotheses are - This is because we want to use that information to help you formulate your research hypotheses - Our goal is not to do a full literature review - A full lit review will also include focus on the results - The first paper summary is part of what would be in an annotated bibliography (no results and no critique yet) - You do not need to print out all the articles you read – If you’re happy working from electronic copies, that’s fine! – But you need to catalog them in an organized fashion, with links and/or PDFs (in particular, keep any PDF you’ve annotated) 5.3 Appropriate Use of Artificial Intelligence for Literature Reviews AI can be helpful with your paper summaries, but it can go disastrously wrong whenever you’re dealing with academic papers The rate of hallucination (making things up) is VERY high You have good papers to start from: forward/reverse cite searches are generally going to be better than AI for finding other valuable papers You can ask AI to find the research questions / hypotheses / theory in the introduction But this is only a start—you need to verify that what it suggests is actually in the text, and whether it actually make sense in context You can write something and THEN ask AI to propose some ways to make your statement clearer But you still need to write the first attempt and verify the suggestion from AI makes sense Similarly, you can ask AI to help fix your mermaid code or make it fancier, but NOT to write it for you from scratch 5.4 Paper Summaries 5.4.1 Paper Summary One Even within the reading, you’ll be doing just part of what Greenlaw explains: focus mainly on the introduction of the paper to figure out what the research questions and hypotheses are. This is because we want to use that information to help you formulate your research hypotheses Our goal right now is not to do a full literature review For the assignment on Wednesday, what you’ll do is part of an abstract or what would be in an annotated bibliography (no results and no critique yet) For your first paper summary: Provide full citation Choose a citation style (last page of Greenlaw Ch. 3) that you like; maybe match what’s used in a paper your sponsor shared Use Google Scholar shortcut to format it Include a URL to the paper if possible. Otherwise, you’ll need to upload a PDF to a folder called “Lit review” on your project repo Explain how you found it (In this case, “Professor ___ suggested it to us.”) What is the big picture question of the paper? What is the specific question / research hypothesis? NEXT WEEK: Include any theory / conceptual framework and research hypotheses (direct quotes if you want—just put them in quotes)] Paper Summary One Example: Kahn, L. B. (2010). The long-term labor market consequences of graduating from college in a bad economy. Labour economics, 17(2), 303-316. Link. How I found this paper: suggested by Professor Zhu Big picture question: What are the effects of graduating college in a poor economy and how long do these negative effects persist? Hypothesis: The economic conditions at the time of college graduation, specifically for white males, can impact their ability to find work for the first two decades of their careers. Specific question: When graduating in a poor economy, are graduates more likely to experience job mismatching and/or experience long-term effects from entering the labor market during a bad time? Hypothesis: If graduating in a worse-off economy, graduates will be more likely to experience job mismatching as there are fewer opportunities available and will suffer higher unemployment rates from the labor market conditions. Note on what kinds of articles should be included: Review article vs. actual frontier research…In order to extract relevant theories from the papers you are reading, it will be more useful to read actual frontier research papers (one study/experiment on a topic with more limited scope) than a review article (also called meta-analyses, compile frontier research papers and review their findings). Working papers versus published articles: Published articles are preferred. Working Papers can be helpful, but if they are more than a few years old, it may be because the author does not believe the work in that paper is of high enough quality to be published. – Reputable economic journal (REPEC list here) 5.4.2 Paper Summary Two For your Second Paper Summary, you will ADD a second paper in the same place you wrote the first paper summary &amp; revise first summary - Add research question at the top of the document - Provide full citation - Use same citation style as for first paper - Include a URL to the paper or upload a PDF to a “Lit_review” folder on your project repo - Explain how you found the article - What is the big picture question of the paper? - What is the specific question and research hypothesis? - For one of the papers: What theory / conceptual framework supports the research hypothesis? - Include in words and also in a causal diagram (more on Wednesday) - Add AI Disclosure Statement (another resource here) More paper summary feedback You only need a hypothesis for the specific question Your citations should include all co-author names, not “et al.“ We use “et al.” in the text of a paper to shorten parenthetical references, but a citation includes all coauthors explicitly It’s a great idea to have a place where you keep extra notes and your intermediate work. It’s also fine to have the document pretty messy while it’s in process. But it should be cleaned up when for review by an outsider The paper summary documents are being built into a cohesive whole; all the elements need to be there for full credit (including your research question) Each one needs to be internally consistent: hypothesis answers the research question, theory says why the hypothesis makes sense, causal diagram matches with the theory statement in words From now on, no AI disclosure statement == automatic zero 5.5 Theorizing Theorizing or Conceptualizing the Research (Greenlaw, Ch. 7). Learning Objectives: Understand what it means to apply theory to a research topic List the elements involved in formal theorizing Explain the steps involved in narrative reasoning Summarize the characteristics of a good research hypothesis Goal: formulate research hypothesis/hypotheses that are founded on economic theories Shortcut: learn about potential conceptual frameworks / theories from the papers in your lit review What makes a good research hypothesis? (From Greenlaw, page 135) stated clearly and specifically in a way that can’t be misinterpreted. able to discriminate clearly from alternative hypotheses. capable of being proved false. empirically testable (and nontrivial); that is, there must be reasonable statistical means and reasonable data available for testing it. must be derived from the theoretical analysis. Example hypotheses: From Greenlaw: “The demand for jewelry depends negatively on the price.” From ChatGPT: “Countries that invest more in research and development (R&amp;D) experience faster economic growth than those that do not.“ “Trade liberalization leads to an increase in income inequality in developing countries.” “Raising the minimum wage leads to a reduction in employment among low-skilled workers.“ “People save more when they are automatically enrolled in savings programs rather than when they have to opt in.” 5.5.1 Theory, Models, and Research Questions Learning objectives: Recognize how theories and models are useful in guiding research Learn how to use a theory to explain an outcome of interest Learn how to use a model to express a theory Understand and explain the following basic concepts: variable, variation (cross-sectional and longitudinal), sign of a relationship (positive and negative), and hypothesis Identify the independent and dependent variables, as well as the unit of analysis, in a particular theory Understand the causal mechanisms that connect independent variables to dependent variables–and how they can be represented in a model as intervening variables Recognize how theories and models are useful in guiding research. In applied social research, a theory… is a causal explanation, guided by reasoning or evidence, of how some aspect of the social world works. is a reasoned and precise speculation about the answer to a research question, including a statement about why the proposed answer is correct. helps us identify and take notice of key variables that we should measure or observe. and a bunch more! A causal mechanism is made explicit in a causal diagram by adding moderator variables. Understand and explain the following basic concepts: variable, variation (cross-sectional and longitudinal), sign of a relationship (positive and negative), and hypothesis: The sign of a relationship… is positive when independent and dependent variables move in the same direction. indicates whether or not two variables move or covary in the same or opposite directions. is NOT the same as the causal direction of a relationship, which is represented by arrows in a causal diagram. 5.5.2 Moving lit review/theory forward We should start using the process in Greenlaw pg. 135-136 to create working research hypotheses, using your paper summaries / lit review as brainstorm - For that to be helpful, you need to write VERY PRECISE hypotheses - Focus on hypotheses that are actually tested in the paper - AND translate them into causal diagrams - Causal diagrams should be integrated into the summary document and align tightly with the theory statement - So, you’ll shape up the hypothesis and theory for the two papers you’ve been working on and submit a list of at least three more papers you plan to summarize Paper Summaries to Hypothesis Formation For each paper summary… If statement of hypothesis is not highly specific, you can’t figure out what theory would support the hypothesis The theory should answer the question: “Why might this hypothesis be true?” That is, the theory is the justification for why the hypothesis is reasonable The hypothesis is the answer to the research question, and Theory and hypothesis are both answers. They can’t be questions. Use causal diagram to help clarify the hypothesis and the theory that supports the hypothesis All the words in the causal diagram should show up in the hypothesis and/or the theory The first and last boxes in the diagram should be something that you can find in your data The point of a hypothesis is to empirically test a relationship. We can’t test a relationship when the implication (the last box) is abstract. It has to be data Your paper summaries will provide guidance To be helpful, your hypotheses need to be VERY PRECISE Focus on hypotheses that are actually tested in the paper 5.5.3 Research Hypothesis Assignment Your team’s research question Tentative hypothesis Theory that supports your tentative hypothesis Causal diagram that connect hypothesis and theory How will you (tentatively) test the hypothesis? What variables from your data will you use to test it? Standard for full credit (4 points): Hypothesis is clearly stated, sensible, tied to faculty member’sguidance and responds to feedback Theory clearly supports hypothesis Causal diagram accurately represents hypothesis and theory Variables for testing hypothesis clearly stated and closely tied to causal diagram and hypothesis Now, let’s think about (testable) hypotheses related to your research question. A good research hypothesis should be (Greenlaw pg. 135)… stated clearly and specifically so that it can’t be misinterpreted Able to discriminate clearly from alternative hypotheses capable of being proved false empirically testable derived from the theoretical analysis. Testable Hypotheses and Theory Hypothesis: “Raising the minimum wage leads to a reduction in employment among low-skilled workers.“ OR: If the minimum wage goes up, the number of employed low-skilled workers goes down. Theory is the “why” in the middle The minimum wage is the cause (independent variable) An independent variable comes first in the causal diagram An arrow shows how it affects the dependent variable A plus or minus sign in the middle of the arrow shows the sign of the relationship The number of employed low-skilled workers is the effect (dependent variable) A dependent variable depends on the level of the independent variable It comes at the end of the causal diagram "],["stata.html", "Section 6 Stata 6.1 Coding 6.2 File Management 6.3 Opening Data in Stata 6.4 Running Code 6.5 GSS Mini Report: Accessing &amp; Visualizing Data 6.6 Outliers Exercise 6.7 Correlations Exercise 6.8 Creating new variables 6.9 Combining datasets", " Section 6 Stata 6.1 Coding What is coding? Computer programming, or coding, is the process of issuing a series of commands (writing instructions) that a computer (or other hardware) can understand and execute in order to perform a task. Imagine a computer as being like a particularly mischievous genie; if your instructions aren’t completely unambiguous, the computer won’t do what you asked for Like a genie though, if you can get the instructions just so, you can create magical things 6.2 File Management File management is the process of creating an organized structure to store information for easy retrieval. Proper file management practices are critical for being able to access data and code files. Every file has an address on your computer, and the location is usually a series of nested folders. – When you’re coding, this address is how you tell the computer/software how to find the file – You can’t tell the computer to search for a file like you do since the computer doesn’t know what YOU think is the right file If you use an Eggers 040 computer, rds.syr.edu, or any on-campus computer, your files will travel with you if you save them to OneDrive. IMPORTANT: the default is to download files from a web browser to the Downloads folder on a computer’s hard drive. This will NOT travel with you. 6.3 Opening Data in Stata 6.3.1 Point and click: Import Wizard These are the steps we took to open up the ECN 310 Class Survey data in Stata. You can use them to repeat that exercise, or to open up other datasets in Stata. Navigate to and open the Stata application Click on File menu, choose Import, then Text data (delimited,*.csv,…) Browse to the location you saved the file in Change “First row as variable names” to “Custom” and “1” (this was what we did for the class survey data, note that this may not always be the option that you need) Click “OK” Following these steps will open the file and generate the first command: import excel. You can see this in the history window or the output window in the middle of the screen. It will look something like… import excel \"C:\\\\Users\\\\username\\\\OneDrive - Syracuse University\\\\Documents\\\\GitHub\\\\exercises\\\\application_survey_anon.xlsx\", sheet(\"anon\") firstrow You can then use this line of code, going forward, to import your data. 6.3.2 Using a line of code If you are opening a Stata data file with a “.dta” file extension, you can use the use command. If you are attempting to open a dataset in Stata that exists as a different type of file, it may be easier to open it using the Point and Click Import Wizard, and then copy that command from the history window. You must find the file path to the dataset you seek to open. Once you navigate to the file in File Explorer, you can copy and paste the path at the top of the window. You must also have the name of the file. It is best practice to copy and paste the file name and the file path instead of re-typing them yourself. Once you have those two things, you can execute the use command in Stata. Such as… use \"C:\\\\Users\\\\username\\\\OneDrive - Syracuse University\\\\Documents\\\\GitHub\\\\exercises\\\\dataset\" 6.4 Running Code 6.4.1 Note on Stata instances Each time you click on a file (e.g., a do-file and a data file), a new copy of Stata opens. To have both a data file and a do-file open in the same instance (copy) of Stata, you’ll need to click on one to open it, then open the other from within Stata. If you have a do-file open in one instance, and data open in a different instance, the code that you run will not operate on the data you are seeking to work with. Note that you can NEVER have two datasets open at the same time in the same instance of Stata. 6.4.2 Three ways to obtain information using Stata Execute command from a do-file Type the command in the do-file Highlight the command Hit “Control+D” Execute command in the Command Window Type the command in the Command Window Press enter Execute the command using a menu Click on the appropriate menu (e.g. Graphics) Choose the command (e.g. Pie Chart) Fill in the dialog box Click on “Submit” or “OK” 6.4.3 Using do-files Use a do-file if… You’re likely to do something similar in the future. Do-files let you save, revise, and rerun commands. You’re going the use anything your code produces. Do-files and the comments within them are a key form of documentation You’re going to share the code or product with anyone 6.5 GSS Mini Report: Accessing &amp; Visualizing Data Task Working in your “GSS Mini Research Report Team”: Pick one variable from the 2016 General Social Survey (GSS2016.dta) that makes sense in a pie chart Enter the variable name in PollEverywhere Your team’s variable must be unique Both team members should submit it Make the pie chart in Stata Save it wherever you want on your computer, as .png or .jpg (NOT as a Stata graph—nothing except Stata can open those) Go to the “First (mini) research report” issue on the exercises repo, https://github.com/ecn310/exercises/discussions/4 Write and submit your report on the Github discussion One report per team Instructions are in the first post I’ll put an example in the first comment on the issue How to access and analyze the data Navigate to the exercises repo on Github In the list toward the left of the screen, click on GSS2016.dta Click on “View raw” or the download symbol all the way on the right of the gray “Code” bar Save the file to your computer, noting the location you save it to Navigate to where you saved the file and double-click on it (this only opens Stata because it’s a .dta) Explore the data in Stata. Use browse to see the data, use describe or describe, short to get a summary of the data file. Explore one variable by using codebook varname, where you input the name of your variable where “varname” is to get an understanding of your variable. Use tabulate varname to see what the observations for that variable look like. Make a pie graph Use graph pie, over(worryjob) to make a pie chart. Use help graph pie to view documentation on the graph pie command. Use graph pie, over(worryjob) title(\"How many people worry about losing their job?\") to add a title. Use graph pie, over(worryjob) title(\"How many people worry about losing their job?\") plabel(_all percent)to add percentages Finally, use graph export \"C:\\Users\\...\\pie_worryjob.png\",as(png), replace to save the graph as an image file. Ensure that you fill in the “…” to match the file path on your computer. Understand and apply syntax for saving a file graph export is the command to save a graph \"C:\\Users\\krist\\OneDrive - Syracuse University\\ECN_310\\pie_worryjob.png\" is the path and file name ON PROFESSOR BUZARD’S COMPUTER, not on yours! You need to customize! , is the required comma between command and options as(png) is the option that saves the file in PNG format replace is the option to write over any existing file in the same location with the same name Mini Report Improvements Go to the “First (mini) research report” discussion on the exercises repo Can anything else be improved? How about making the pie chart smaller? Make .do file that produces the image in your post (detailed instructions on next slide) Upload your do-file to the GSS_mini_report folder (detailed instructions in two slides) As a reply (leave your original post alone!!!) to your original comment, post improved version: image is smaller; image matches .do file; has new sentence at the bottom that says something like “The code that created this pie chart is here” where “here” is a link. You will make a .do file that produces the image in your post. Professor Buzard will run it and make sure your code works/matches what’s in your post. Start by… - Opening Stata, choose Window menu, then Do-File Editor, then New Do-File Editor - The first line of your .do file should be the command to open the data - Insert code to produce the same pie chart from last week - End the file with command to save the pie chart at end - Save file as name1_name2.do (e.g., Dylan_Soph.do) to your computer - Then, upload your do-file to the GSS_mini_report folder: - Navigate to GSS_mini report folder of the exercises repository - Above the list of files, select the Add file dropdown menu and click Upload files. - Alternatively, you can drag and drop files into your browser. - To select your do-file for upload, drag and drop the file, or click choose your files - In the “Commit message” field, type a short, meaningful commit message - Below the commit message fields, choose “Commit directly to the main branch” - Click “Commit changes” - Refresh the GSS_mini_report page and click on your file to make sure it looks right - Copy the url to add to your post on the discussion 6.6 Outliers Exercise Learning Objectives: Using Log Files and Saving Your Work (Daniels &amp; Minot, 4.5) Start and save a log by issuing commands at the beginning and end of a do-file. Understand the text, replace, and append options on the log command Implement best practices for saving files Cleaning Data and Checking for Outliers (Daniels &amp; Minot, 5.1 and 5.2) Recognize what “cleaning” your data means Find and fix outliers in data, clearly documenting any changes to the dataset How to Make Sure Your Research Paper is Reproducible (World Bank Blogs, First paragraph, “What does reproducibility mean?“, Tip 6) Comprehend what reproducibility means and the main sources of reproducibility failure Task Find and fix outliers in data, clearly documenting any changes to the dataset - Use codebook varname to get codebook for single variable - tabulate varname gives a table of all values - Use summarize varname to get summary statistics - If you change an outlier in any way, it MUST be documented - DON’T just go into the data editor and change it. - This leaves no record; it’s legitimately TERRIBLE science. People have lost their careers over this - No one (including yourself or your team members) will be able to replicate your dataset if they don’t know what you did - DO write code in your .do file like on the bottom of D&amp;M pg. 62 (Section 5.2) - When doing something like this for your project, acknowledge that you’ve done it in your global documentation and point to the location in the issue to which it contributes Do files Do file is a complete set of instructions for completing a task Log file is a record of how the task was executed (all the output) Need to put all substantive code after the log starts Log close should be at the very end You always experiment and learn as you build a do-file Once you think your do-file is perfect, close Stata, open again, run the do-file all at once to produce a clean log without errors To run the whole do-file at once, instead of highlighting one line and hitting Ctrl+D, just hit Ctrl+D with nothing highlighted Keep iterating until… no errors when you run the .do file (1) files are in the right place (2) log matches your do-file exactly (3) Outline for the do-file you’ll create cd Once you issue the cd command, you don’t need to type the whole path in the use and save statements cd changes the working directory to the location you want Stata will now default to looking in your new working directory to find files to open and will place things there when you save So, you’ll just need the file name without the file path in front of it If you put the file path ahead of the file name, it won’t break your code, but it’s bad for reproducibility log to start the log file use to open the data [insert data analysis and modification code] save to save the data Save the data to the same folder for this exercise as where your log, do-file, and the supplied data are log close Outliers Team Exercise Instructions Each team’s goal Find and fix outliers in GSS2016_outliers.dta Save a cleaned version of the .dta file (do NOT modify the original) Create a .do file that executes each step Use a log file to document your work; log MUST match .do file Upload all three files to central Github exercisesfolder Ensure .do file and log MATCH (that is, if I re-run your do file, I will get the same log except for my file path) Step 1: (At least) One member of the team uses Github Desktop to make sure you have the most recent version of the exercises repo on your computer Step 2: Create a do-file in Stata named “firstname1_firstname2_outliers.do” and save it in the exercises\\outliers folder (the version on your computer) Step 3: Execute the sub-steps below with commands in your .do file: Open a log (use text and replace options) in outliers folder (D&amp;M p. 51) – log using “[insert the path to the folder on your computer]\\firstname1_firstname2_outliers”, text replace Change the path to the outliers folder using cd command (pg. 51) Open GSS2016_outliers.dta (command: use) Report summary stats for variable chldidel using sum command Check chldidel for outliers using codebook and tabulate Fix any outliers via a command in the do-file (pg. 62) Run sum, codebook, and tab again to verify problem is fixed Save modified data file in outliers folder as firstname1_firstname2_outliers.dta (p. 54) Close log (p. 51-53) [use log close, NOT log off] Step 4: Commit the three files to the outliers folder in the exercises repo using Github Desktop a. Click “Fetch origin” and “pull origin” in top right of Github Desktop b. Enter a descriptive commit message and click “Commit to main” c. On web interface: make sure all three files are in the outliers folder, named correctly, and the contents of .do and log files match Outliers Exercise Feedback Look at the commit messages on exercises repo Look at the outliers folder on exercises repo Need to follow the naming convention for the log Make Stata results window wider so log is easier to read If you lose your do file or some of its contents, your log file can save you Don’t replace the outlier value another (more standard) value. This indicates that you know for sure that this respondent really meant they want to have 10 children It’s better to make it missing (“.”) Remember to close everything and re-run until the do file runs cleanly so your log matches your do file 6.7 Correlations Exercise Learning Objectives (Daniels &amp; Minot, Article 12.1, Section 12.3): Employ and interpret scatter plots to learn about the relationship between two variables Employ and interpret Pearson correlation coefficients (either corr or pwcorr), including the statistical significance of the correlation Recognize the limitations of correlation analysis Also some information in Remler &amp; VanRyzin Ch. 2: Understand and explain the concept of correlation Employ and interpret Pearson correlation coefficients, including the statistical significance of the correlation: The Pearson correlation coefficient, or r,… - measures the strength of the relationship between two continuous variables. - is calculated using the number of observations, the values of the variables, and the means of the variables. - varies between -1 and +1. - Equals 0 when there is no correlation. This exercise has a bunch of goals: Make sure you’re comfortable using Github to download and upload files Become more comfortable with variables and units of analysis Reinforce readings on hypotheses and theory Deepen your understanding of the reading on correlations via a simple economic example Correlations, scatterplots, and the sign of relationships Provide some examples of good code commenting Help you become more comfortable with Stata do-files, logs, and file management You will modify an existing do file so it works on your computer You’ll have an example of what the log should look like Recall the importance of reproducibility in your code (and your research paper): The most common reasons for code to be non-transferrable are… the reproducibility package does not include all the required code or data files. the code uses file paths that only exist in the machine where they were last run. there are no clear instructions on what steps the reviewer should follow to recreate final results. Datasets Open up exercises\\correlations\\CPS_2017.dta It’s a sample of the 2017 CPS (Current Population Survey from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics) Unit of analysis: (there is one row for) each person who was surveyed in 2017 (ages 25 to 30) Your data is not automatically in the unit of analysis you need Example: zipcentercrime had individual 911 calls, but need to know how many 911 calls in a given area They have to transform their data Variables: (one column for each of) 20 variables age, hours, wage, earn (weekly earnings), etc. “Correlations” Exercise Requirements Upload your do file and log file to the correlations folder on the exercises repo (1 point each) Point subtracted if you upload more than these two files Follow naming convention in instructions (1 point) Log should be in text format (1 point) Log should look just like sample_log, except it should use a directory on your computer and have the name of your log (1 point) Log should also match do-file (no editing the log name outside of running the do-file, or editing the log after running the do-file) (1 point) Step 1: Get the files from GitHub Open Github Desktop Choose exercises repo Click “Fetch origin” in top center of the GUI Click “Pull origin” when it just said “Fetch origin” This brings the new files I created onto your computer On Repository menu (top of Github Desktop), choose “Show in Explorer” Double click on the “correlations” folder in Windows Explorer Click in address bar to get path Copy this path (you’ll need it in a minute) Step 2: Save a copy of the do-file, modify, and run it Open the do-file Stata_CPS_101525.do “Save as” in the correlations folder, add “YOURNAME_” to the beginning of the filename (e.g. Ryan_Stata_CPS_101525.do) Replace the path after the cd command with the path you copied on line 23 Change the name of the log file (instructions in comment) on line 27 Run the code step by step to make sure it works and that you understand the correlations, scatterplots, and associated theories Save the do-file and close Stata Re-open YOUR do-file and hit “Ctrl+D” (don’t highlight anything) Open YOUR log (make sure it’s a Text Document) by clicking on it in Windows Explorer to make sure it looks like MY log except the path and log name should match your path and log name Step 3: Upload files to Github 1. Make sure your two files (log and do-file) show up in Github Desktop in the correlations folder on the exercises repo and are named correctly. 2. Write a substantive commit message 3. Click “Commit to main” 4. Click “Push origin” at top right - Click “Fetch origin” and “Pull origin” first if “Push Origin” isn’t there 5. Navigate to the exercises repo on the Github UI (web interface) 6. Open the correlations folder 7. Make sure your two files (log and do-file) are there 8. Click on the do-file to make sure it looks my do-file, but with your path 9. Click on the log to make sure it looks like my log, but with your path Notes: - A refresher on the Github commands: Clone / Pull / Push / Fetch - You can upload files directly through the Github UI if you can’t make it work in Github Desktop. Instructions here. 6.8 Creating new variables Learning objectives (Daniels &amp; Minot Section 5.3, pp. 63-64, 67-69) Use the generate or gen command to create simple new variables from the existing variables. This is the most basic, simple command for creating new variables. Use the egen command to create a new variable by aggregating the existing data. egen is more powerful and a little more complicated. Demonstration using gss_new_variables.do in exercises repo Best way to use this: sync your exercises repo using Github desktop, then open the do file from your machine (it will be in the main exercises folder) 6.9 Combining datasets Combining datasets (Stata Manual); Combining datasets (Notre Dame Hesbergh Library) Learning objectives: Recognize the usefulness of combining datasets. Choose when to apply merge versus append versus joinby to combine datasets in Stata. Employ the merge and append commands to combine datasets in Stata. Sync the exercises repo to your machine Open combining_datasets folder Open combining_datasets_exercise.do You could also take a look at the excel file, but make sure to close it before running any of the code "],["latex.html", "Section 7 LaTeX and Overleaf 7.1 LaTeX Overview 7.2 Overleaf Projects", " Section 7 LaTeX and Overleaf Overleaf Logistics You will need to… create FREE Overleaf account: https://www.overleaf.com/register give Professor Buzard the email address you used to set up the account on the in-class poll: PollEv.com/kbuzard Professor Buzard will give you access to your team’s Overleaf project 7.1 LaTeX Overview LaTeX is like a fancier version of rmarkdown. You can explore its basic commands on the LearnLaTeX website.

Make sure you let her know on one of your GitHub issues. LaTeX write up for data.tex… Completely customize the data.tex template for your project for Sections 1, 2, 3, and 6 (don’t leave any of Professor Buzard’s instructions or examples in these sections) You can ignore Sections 4 and 5 for now Provide one complete subsection in Section 2 Data Overview (provide details for each piece I included in the template) for each data set you are considering using List at least four key variables in Section 6 (and potentially a dozen or more). Indicate which variables are found in which datasets (subsections work well for this if you have more than one dataset) Ensure there are no LaTeX compilation errors Troubleshooting Overleaf errors: If there’s a red number immediately to the right of the “Recompile” button, click it First Feedback on data.tex PLEASE do things early to get feedback and improve the final submission!!! Overleaf Double click to move to the right place in the document Navigate using the table of contents Make URLS into URL links, or better, embed in relevant descriptive text (just like in Markdown) If AI disclosure statement doesn’t make sense in a document or other submission, submit it in the relevant task issue when you say submission is ready for review Note on Overleaf file size limit different from Github’s 100mb limit – Overleaf’s is 50mb It’s also MUCH better practice to upload files directly to the Github file structure; otherwise, it’s hard to find where that single link is on an issue 7.2.1 Tables and Figures in the Report Insert figures in LaTeX Insert tables in LaTeX (must be customized) \\begin{table}[htbp] \\caption{\\textbf{enter caption here}} \\label{tab:mlogit} \\scriptsize \\begin{center} \\input{file_from_outreg.tex} \\end{center} \\flushleft \\begin{footnotesize} \\begin{singlespace} \\textbf{Notes}: Description of your table here. \\end{singlespace} \\end{footnotesize} \\end{table} 7.2.2 Tables in your presentation &amp; report Options for putting tables in report [RECOMMENDED #1] Use outreg2 to output the table formatted in LaTeX (some helpful slides) Outreg output gets stored with your other research outputs, and contents can be imported into your .tex file using the “input” command inside a table Save as .tex instead of .doc Use in \\input statement from the insert table code above. You need to submit the command “ssc install outreg2” at the command line in Stata to install outreg [RECOMMENDED #2] Represent output with figure instead of table (case specific, have to think about this) [TERRIBLE IDEA] Make the table manually in LaTeX Instructions here This is really annoying because you have to edit it manually every time your data changes; bad for reproducibility "],["data.html", "Section 8 Data 8.1 Project Data Check-In 8.2 Putting Together Your Data Set 8.3 Distinguish between types of variables 8.4 Project Data Summary Assignment (data.tex)", " Section 8 Data 8.1 Project Data Check-In You will have to write documenation for your team’s project data that will include… Short description of the data Includes number of variables, number of observations for each data set (you may have more than one data set) Explanation of where the data comes from / how someone can acquire it / where you have stored it List of key variables you may use for testing your hypothesis How you will link different data sets together if necessary You will need to answer… Has our team already accessed all the data we need? (If not) Do we have a plan to access it? (If not) What do we need to be able to make a plan? 8.2 Putting Together Your Data Set Learning objectives (Greenlaw Ch. 9, pp. 160-163): Develop a search strategy for finding your data (applies even if you have a dataset recommended by a faculty member) Obtain data that correctly measure the concepts that your theory deems important Develop a search strategy for finding your data: In order to find data that correctly measure the concepts that your theory deems important, START by reviewing your theoretical model. ask, “What variables do I need data for to test my research hypothesis?” rethink your hypothesis if you can’t answer the question, “If I could obtain ideal data, what variables would they include?” Greenlaw Ch. 9 assumes you already have your hypothesis. We’ll use its ideas to help you reverse-engineer a hypothesis if necessary To start: What variables do you have that are related to the research question? Obtain data that correctly measure the concepts that your theory deems important. Which question should you ask as you investigate a data source? What data are, in fact, available? If the data are not good enough, are they good enough? If the data are not acceptable and there is no adequate proxy, how can the hypothesis be reformulated to make it testable, given the data available? Proxy: a variable that substitutes for another unavailable or unobserved variable (R&amp;vR p. 113) This is needed when it’s too difficult or costly to directly quantify the ideal variable, or the ideal variable is not included in available datasets 8.2.1 Proxy Variables “Proxy variables are data that we hope captures the quantitative essence of a thing without actually measuring a thing. They are used a lot in data projects, mostly because we often don’t have the data we actually want or need.” (From weallcount.com) When you can’t directly measure the data you need, choose the best available proxy. GDP for standard of living NOT recessions for tightness of the labor market, since the unemployment rate is a better proxy 8.3 Distinguish between types of variables ordinal categorical variables nominal categorical variables continuous variables on an interval scale a measure that has a numerical value and the magnitude between the intervals is the same continuous variables on a ratio scale a measure that is the same as an interval measure, but it also has a true zero value (a complete absence of what is being measured) Table 6.1 on page 76 of Daniels &amp; Minot is your best friend Open Github\\exercises\\Daniels_Minot_data\\College Results.dta • Can you find one example of each type of variable? See Table 6.1 • label list command is helpful 8.3.1 Visualizing Variable Types Exercise: Make appropriate use of bar graphs and histograms. With College Results.dta open: graph bar (count), over(atsp) Now try it with the “AvgNetPriceAfterGrants” variable What’s going on? Use codebook command histogram AvgNetPriceAfterGrants, percent Change the number of “bins”: histogram AvgNetPriceAfterGrants, bin(10) percent What graph type would you use for variable “Size3”? Can you produce at least one histogram or bar chart for your project data? 8.4 Project Data Summary Assignment (data.tex) Completely customize the data.tex template for your project (don’t leave any of my instructions or examples). This must include all six sections from my template unless you only have one data source and one data file–that is, no merging is needed Provide one complete subsection in Section 2 Data Overview (provide details for each piece I included in the template) with details for each data set you are using. If you only have one dataset, you can remove the subsection command. Section 3 should give both the instructions for downloading your data and also links to what you’ve downloaded. Section 4 should point to your .do file and give a summary of any manipulation you had to do. If you don’t need to merge to any more data, this is where you provide a link to the dataset that is ready for analysis. If you have more than one raw data file, Section 5 says how you merge them together and this is where you provide a link to a dataset that is ready for analysis. List all your key variables in Section 6. Indicate which variables are found in which datasets (subsections work well for this if you have more than one dataset). Include the type of each of your key variables (ordinal, nominal, interval scale, ratio scale) and what kind of descriptive statistics you’ll use for each variable (D&amp;M Table 6.1) These MUST line up with the variables you specify for hypothesis testing on the hypothesis assignment. Include anything useful you’ve learned from the descriptive stats exercise (don’t just repeat everything from your four submissions; I mean things like figuring out exactly what a variable means, that there’s something strange going on with a variable that needs more investigation, etc.) Ensure there are no LaTeX errors. Submit AI disclosure statement on your data acquisition issue when you tell me data.tex is ready for review.

Distinguish between ordinal categorical variables, nominal categorical variables, continuous variables on an interval scale, and continuous variables on a ratio scale. Include the number of missing values in a frequency table and think critically about which values are missing. Make appropriate use of bar graphs and histograms. Analyze data (ordinal, interval scale, ratio scale) using the median and percentiles of a variable. Analyze continuous data using mean, variance, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation. 9.1.1 Median Median is 50th percentile Equivalent: rank a variable from lowest to highest and identify the observation that falls exactly in the middle.

Choose one variable of interest in your project’s data Everyone on your team must use a different variable Explore the variable using tools we’ve learned from D&amp;M Share something you learn about the variable on the “Descriptive statistics exercise” discussion (example in first comment) Say what dataset you’re using and where it comes from Explain what the variable means Share one APPROPRIATE figure (e.g. histogram or bar chart) Calculate one related descriptive statistic (mean, median, standard deviation, frequency, etc) Explain what you’ve learned through the combination of your figure and descriptive statistic They should NOT be two unrelated facts How might this information impact your choices when doing analysis? What do you learn that makes you think about your data differently, or what questions does it raise? Formatting Guidelines Put everything in narrative form (not bullet points) like in a report it’s meant to tell a story, not be presented as Q&amp;A. The list of questions is there to guide you. Part of what I want you to practice is how to weave facts together into a story. No screenshots Especially for descriptive stats—use the stats in a sentence We’re using this to start to move toward how we would write in the report, and we would never put a screenshot in a report. Consider size and centering of your graph The standard way of talking about skewness is really counterintuitive; I suggest saying that it’s skewed, then where most of the observations are (or where few of the observations are), not “skewed toward“ Your narrative should say something definitive about scale and definition of your variable; you may have to dig into a codebook To talk about variance, you have to contextualize with the mean–variance/standard deviation can’t be interpreted on its own 9.2 Null Hypothesis Daniels &amp; Minot, pp. 121-122, 124-125 (Section 7.4, 7.6, 7.7) Learning objectives: Define the term null hypothesis and formulate a null hypothesis related to your research question. Use p-values (the book calls this the “alpha level”) to determine when the null hypothesis can be rejected. The alpha level (or p-value) is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. is the probability of a Type 1 error. is typically set at 0.05. We DO NOT say that we “accept” the null hypothesis when the p-value is below 0.05. This is because samples do not always accurately reflect the population. 9.2.1 Null hypotheses for projects Tariffs: Domestic taxes will increase in developed countries that limit tariffs. This relationship will be stronger in countries with high import-to-GDP ratios than in countries with low import-to-GDP ratios. (?) Supply Chain: Need to find Parent: Parents in U.S. counties with higher intergenerational mobility invest more time in their children compared to parents in counties with lower intergenerational mobility 9.3 One-Sample t Test Daniels &amp; Minot, pp. 133-135, 137-139 (Section 8.2, 8.4, 8.5) Learning objectives: Determine when it is appropriate to use the one-sample t test. Conduct one-sample t tests in Stata and interpret the results. 9.3.1 One sample t-test demo (Stata) * Decide how many draws of data we want set obs 1000 * Generate data from normal distribution with mean = 1, standard deviation = 0.1 gen X = rnormal(1, 0.1) * Test whether mean of X is equal to 0, or to 1 ttest X == 0 ttest X == 1 * Repeat above but for larger standard deviation gen Y = rnormal(1, 1) ttest Y == 0 ttest Y == 1 9.4 Two Independent-Samples t Test Daniels &amp; Minot, pp. 144-145, 146-152 (Section 9.2, 9.4, 9.5) Learning objectives: Determine when it is appropriate to use a two independent-samples t test.

For an argument to be persuasive the reasons supporting it must be true, and the conclusion must follow from those reasons. 10.2.1 Writing as a Product of Economic Analysis Learning objectives (Greenlaw Ch. 5): Articulate what is required when ‘writing as product’ Your audience is your sponsoring professor and other academic economists Your writing should be formal, clear, include sufficient (but not too many) details Describe how experienced writers allocate their time between the writing steps You should spend the most time on pre-writing and revising List the five features of good economic writing Understand the importance of writing the first draft quickly (different from soon) You’re not going to write the first draft of the whole report all at once Data section first, then results Avoid plagiarism Realize your project’s potential by leaving time to revise and edit You forego substantial improvements if you only write one draft One of the most disappointing comments to write on students’ final papers is “This would make an excellent first draft.” In other words, it has great potential but that potential was not realized. 10.2.2 Final Project Report Sections Pull Github updates to your Overleaf team repo (1 person!) project_template.tex outlines the typical sections you should have (others are possible) Abstract Intro Lit review Theory / Hypothesis (can be in intro or separate section) Data Results Discussion Conclusion References / Bibliography 10.2.3 Data vs. Results Sections Data section: Where you got data from, how it was generated, what variables you use Give a very high-level summary of any crucial data cleaning/merging steps you had to take Include a table of summary statistics for all the variables you’re working with Results section: State your working hypothesis and null hypothesis Explain why the statistics you’re presenting are appropriate Present statistics and explain what they mean (e.g., do your results support the working hypothesis?) Some feedback on Data and Results Outlines: An outline has bullet-point-like statements that convey your idea Put everything in the present tense, active voice 10.2.4 Communicating the results of a research project: Greenlaw Ch. 12 Learning Objectives: Describe the purpose of a research report Describe how you tested your hypothesis and what you found Write introduction last! For now, focus on getting your working hypothesis nailed down and your data ready to test it – Until you see the basic story that is embedded in your data, you don’t really have enough to go on to even start the intro Results (aka empirical analysis) section the type of statistical analysis you employed the results you hypothesized your actual results your interpretation of the results. 10.2.5 What does (and doesn’t) go in the final report When writing the report… Project report is NOT about the research process don’t include details like how the team worked together, intermediate steps that didn’t work out, etc. report your results and anything needed to understand them Statements like “We compiled a variety of charts and graphs to analyze our data and eventually reach our conclusion.” are distracting and unhelpful because this is what is always done in a report Logistics of how to get data and manipulate data go in appendix/reproducibility package Say what you did in the body of the report say how you did it in the appendix/replication package no code or excessive detail in the text of the report–notice you never see that in the body of the papers you read 10.2.6 Greenlaw on writing for research Greenlaw Ch. 4: Using Writing as a Tool for Economic Research The purpose of scholarly writing is to make an argument that is persuasive to experts in the field. For an argument to be persuasive the reasons supporting it must be true, and the conclusion must follow from those reasons. Construct arguments that are well supported, logical, and hierarchical (pg. 51) Ensure that your conclusions follow from your evidence (pg. 53) Greenlaw Ch. 5: Writing as a Product of Economic Analysis - Ensure your thesis is clear, the paper is well-organized, and your points are supported with evidence (p. 73-76) - Employ good writing style to enable your readers to easily comprehend your writing (p. 82-87) - Pay attention to writing mechanics (p. 87-89) - Mechanics: Grammarly, ChatGPT, Writing Center… - DON’T double space! (Greenlaw says to, but I HATE it). - “Don’t worry about the length of your paper. Never add ‘filler.’ If you go through the writing process described here, you will have enough to say to satisfy your assignment. - Of course, this assumes that you have thought through your topic carefully and completely during the drafting and revision steps. If you haven’t, filler won’t help.” (p. 87) Greenlaw Ch. 12: Communicating the results of a research project Results (aka empirical analysis) section: the type of statistical analysis you employed, the results you hypothesized, your actual results, your interpretation of the results (p. 241-245) “page-long paragraphs suggest insufficiently deep thinking about the story you are telling. Remember, a paragraph is supposed to explain a single thought.“(p. 249) Employ figures (charts, tables and other graphics) to summarize and illustrate the argument in the text of your report (p. 235) "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
