# Writing for Research {#writing}


## Setting Up Your Project Report Template 

Let’s get set up for writing drafts and your final project (only one person should do this per team)

1. Overleaf: sync your most recent changes to Github
a. Github Desktop: check if this create a “branch”
b. If so, you’ll have to merge the branch into your “main” branch
2. Github desktop: sync project repo to your computer
3. Your computer: make a copy of project_template.tex; rename the copy Projectname_report.tex
4. Github Desktop: commit the change and push to Github
5. Overleaf: “Pull Github changes into Overleaf”

Now everyone can see your report template in Overleaf!



## Using Writing as a Tool for Economic Research

Learning objectives

1. Construct arguments that are well supported, logical, and hierarchical
2. Ensure that your conclusions follow from your evidence
3. List the desirable characteristics of evidence

The purpose of scholarly writing is to make an argument that is persuasive to experts in the field.

- For an argument to be persuasive the reasons supporting it must be true, and the conclusion must follow from those reasons.


### Writing as a Product of Economic Analysis

Learning objectives (Greenlaw Ch. 5):

1. Articulate what is required when ‘writing as product’
- Your audience is your sponsoring professor and other academic economists
- Your writing should be formal, clear, include sufficient (but not too many) details
2. Describe how experienced writers allocate their time between the writing steps
- You should spend the most time on pre-writing and revising
3. List the five features of good economic writing
4. Understand the importance of writing the first draft quickly (different from soon)
- You’re not going to write the first draft of the whole report all at once
- Data section first, then results
5. Avoid plagiarism
6. Realize your project’s potential by leaving time to revise and edit
- You forego substantial improvements if you only write one draft
- One of the most disappointing comments to write on students' final papers is "This would make an excellent first draft." In other words, it has great potential but that potential was not realized.


### Final Project Report Sections

Pull Github updates to your Overleaf team repo (1 person!) project_template.tex outlines the typical sections you should have (others are possible)

- Abstract
- Intro 
- Lit review 
- Theory / Hypothesis (can be in intro or separate section)
- Data 
- Results
- Discussion
- Conclusion
- References / Bibliography 

### Data vs. Results Sections

- Data section:
  - Where you got data from, how it was generated, what variables you use
  - Give a very high-level summary of any crucial data cleaning/merging steps you had to take
  - Include a table of summary statistics for all the variables you’re working with
- Results section:
  - State your working hypothesis and null hypothesis
  - Explain why the statistics you’re presenting are appropriate
  - Present statistics and explain what they mean (e.g., do your results support the working hypothesis?)
  
**Some feedback on Data and Results Outlines:**

- An outline has bullet-point-like statements that convey your idea
- Put everything in the present tense, active voice


#### Data details that go in the report

This framework ensures that your report remains concise and focused while the appendix and reproducibility package provide comprehensive technical details.

- **High-Level Description of the Data:** Include a summary of the data source(s), key variables, number of observations, and the time or geographical scope of the data
  - Describe your variables in the Data Section so the reader can understand your Results Section—that's the whole point of the data section
- **Core Assumptions and Transformations:** Mention any essential preprocessing steps that significantly affect your results (e.g., normalizations, filtering criteria, etc.)
- **Key Descriptive Statistics:** Provide tables or figures with summary statistics of the most critical variables used in your analysis
- **Connection to Research Question:** Focus on how the data and variables directly tie into answering your hypothesis or research question


### Communicating the results of a research project:

Greenlaw Ch. 12 Learning Objectives:

1. Describe the purpose of a research report
2. Describe how you tested your hypothesis and what you found

Write introduction last!

- For now, focus on getting your working hypothesis nailed down and your data ready to test it
– Until you see the basic story that is embedded in your data, you don't really have enough to go on to even start the intro
- Results (aka empirical analysis) section
  - the type of statistical analysis you employed
  - the results you hypothesized
  - your actual results
  - your interpretation of the results.

### What does (and doesn't) go in the final report

When writing the report…

- Project report is NOT about the research process
  - don't include details like how the team worked together, intermediate steps that didn’t work out, etc.
  - report your results and anything needed to understand them
  - Statements like "We compiled a variety of charts and graphs to analyze our data and eventually reach our conclusion." are distracting and unhelpful because this is what is always done in a report
  - Logistics of how to get data and manipulate data go in appendix/reproducibility package
- Say what you *did* in the body of the report
  - say *how* you did it in the appendix/replication package
  - no code or excessive detail in the text of the report--notice you never see that in the body of the papers you read
  

### Greenlaw and Daniel's & Minot on writing for research

**Greenlaw Ch. 4:** Using Writing as a Tool for Economic Research

The purpose of scholarly writing is to make an argument that is persuasive to experts in the field.

- For an argument to be persuasive the reasons supporting it must be true, and the conclusion must follow from those reasons.
- Construct arguments that are well supported, logical, and hierarchical (pg. 51)
- Ensure that your conclusions follow from your evidence (pg. 53)

**Greenlaw Ch. 5:** Writing as a Product of Economic Analysis
- Ensure your thesis is clear, the paper is well-organized, and your points are supported with evidence (p. 73-76)
- Employ good writing style to enable your readers to easily comprehend your writing (p. 82-87)
- Pay attention to writing mechanics (p. 87-89)
  - Mechanics: Grammarly, ChatGPT, Writing Center…
  - DON’T double space! (Greenlaw says to, but I HATE it).
- “Don't worry about the length of your paper. Never add ‘filler.’ If you go through the writing process described here, you will have enough to say to satisfy your assignment.
  - Of course, this assumes that you have thought through your topic carefully and completely during the drafting and revision steps. If you haven't, filler won't help.” (p. 87)

**Greenlaw Ch. 12:** Communicating the results of a research project

- Results (aka empirical analysis) section: the type of statistical analysis you employed, the results you hypothesized, your actual results, your interpretation of the results (p. 241-245)
- "page-long paragraphs suggest insufficiently deep thinking about the story you are telling. Remember, a paragraph is supposed to explain a single thought.“(p. 249)
- Employ figures (charts, tables and other graphics) to summarize and illustrate the argument in the text of your report (p. 235)


Learning objectives

1. Use your introduction to provide the rationale for your research and summarize your results
2. Employ figures (charts, tables and other graphics) to summarize and illustrate the argument in the text of your report
3. Highlight the literature that sheds light on your research question in the written literature review

- Write introduction last!
  - It’s a summary of your whole “story”
  - There’s no use writing it until you know what the story is
- The purpose of charts, tables, and other graphics is to summarize and illustrate the argument in the text
  - Every figure should be designed to be easily understood independent of the text


The literature review should include the following:

- the major published studies on your topic.
- a short discussion of what is lacking in the literature.
- how your project contributes to the literature.

The summaries you did were NOT complete—they focused on question, theory, hypothesis

- You’ll need to add methods/results to your current summaries
- Summarize any additional papers you’ve found since then
- Minimum 7 papers total; should probably be closer to ten (more is fine)
- In your outline (and the prose version you write later), use author names and years in parentheses to refer to papers, not full paper titles
  - [BibTex](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Bibliography_management_with_bibtex) will do this for you

**Daniels & Minot Ch. 15.5-6**

- Data
  - They say: summary stat table in Results Section, but put it in Data Section
- Results
  - Can include an interpretation of the results / possible policy implications
    - Or: this can go in a separate “Discussion” section
  - We don't put correlations tables into papers.
    - See D&M 15.5.3 for instructions about how to report these kinds of results
    - Including the result in the log of a do-file is sufficient for reproducibility
- Discussion
  - Interpret your results and place them within the context of the literature
  - Offer recommendations, identify limitations, suggest future research
  - Can go in results if short
- Conclusion
  - Summarize the main findings of the paper, relate them back to the big ideas presented in the introduction, and emphasize their importance

## Outlines

### Some feedback on Data and Results Outlines

- An outline has bullet-point-like statements that convey your idea
- Put everything in the present tense, active voice

### Outline Lit Review / Add References

- Follow instructions from Greenlaw Ch. 12 and the report template (should have been carried over into your report)
- Your lit review should not contain much theory
  - Maybe a little if you are borrowing heavily from another paper(s)
  - You should definitely be up front about this if you are
    - I had you find the theories in related papers to help you brainstorm a theory that makes sense for your project
- This does NOT mean all that material should go in the lit review
- Your lit review is primarily about comparing / contrasting what you're doing to the similar papers in the literature

### Outline Intro/Discussion/Conclusions

- Follow instructions from Greenlaw Ch. 12 and the report template (your story has to congeal this week!!!)
- You will delete the questions like “Why should the reader care?” when you turn this into prose, but you can leave them for now
- Revise the hypothesis/theory portion of intro given feedback on tomorrow’s submission
- Submit AI Disclosure Statement on the relevant Github issue in your repo
- Make sure there are zero compilation errors in LaTeX
