## What is economic research?

Remler & Van Ryzin’s definition:

- “A social and intellectual activity that involves systematic inquiry aimed at accurately describing and explaining the world”


Primary research (our focus), aims to establish new facts and reach new conclusions to create knowledge

- That is, it pushes out the frontier of what is already known
- It is heavily influenced by the perspectives of the researcher

The process of research...

- involves the collection, organization, and analysis of information
- is fundamentally creative
- requires critical thinking
- is iterative, non-linear, less straightforward than a lot of coursework
- is  a social and intellectual activity that involves systematic inquiry aimed at accurately describing and explaining the world.
