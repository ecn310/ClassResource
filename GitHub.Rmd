## Collaboration & Documentation on Github

**Using comments/notifications/commits for collaboration**

- In general, you have to “mention” (@username) someone for them to get a notification
- You can mention individuals or a whole team
- If you edit a comment, a notification isn’t usually sent
  - When you make a change in response to someone’s comment, mention people (@username) who need to know in a new comment
  - Use “blame” feature to figure out where to leave a comment on a file
  - Use detailed commit messages so your teammates know what you’ve accomplished
- Also make sure to report it in your project log (linking to output whenever possible)
  - Use preview before committing so you have fewer commits (avoids formatting errors, obvious mistakes)

It's going to work best to have your work product in an .md file, .do file, discussion or issue

- Then you can just link to each piece from your documentation
- Your log is your only documentation for now
- Soon, we’ll start comprehensive documentation on Overleaf (LaTeX)
  - A Google doc or similar is okay for early work as long as you link to it your documentation and the link is open access
- everything will be formalized into Overleaf soon

## GitHub Desktop

To create a folder to hold papers for your lit review, either

1. Create the file using the Github UI (“user interface”— the web interface we’ve been using). Two ways to do it are described [here](https://www.warp.dev/terminus/how-to-create-folder-in-github)
2. Download Github desktop and use that interface
  - (IMPORTANT: Do NOT just keep clicking if something doesn’t work—ask for help)

Instructions are here to download Github desktop

- Click File, Clone Repository and enter URL of your repo
- Open Windows Explorer (window + E), navigate to “Local path”
- Create a folder called “Literature” with at least one paper in it in the local path
- commit it in Github desktop
- Click “Push origin” at top right
- Look at new commit and new folder on Github UI (website)

Note: it is best to have your GitHub folders within OneDrive.
